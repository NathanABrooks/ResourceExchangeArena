""" Takes pre-prepared data from the SimulationVisualiserInitiator class and produces a line graphs demonstrating how agent satisfaction and population
varies throughout a typical day.

Parameters
---------
folderName : str
    The output destination folder, used to organise output data.
tag : str
    A unique tag so that generated graphs can easily be associated with their corresponding data sets.
data : str
    The absolute path of the data set required for generating the line graph.
typicalSocial : str
    The typical social run to be visualised.
typicalSelfish : str
    The typical selfish run to be visualised.
