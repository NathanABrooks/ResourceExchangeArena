## Project Description
Multi-agent systems that utilise social learning have previously been shown to be an effective model for exploring approaches to collective action problems requiring cooperation between self-interested individuals [1][2]. Where common-pool resources are limited, these models have shown that by enforcing their own institutional rules groups of individuals can avoid the tragedy of the commons and improve their collective performance [3][4][5].

One of the most pressing collective action problems in the world today is the issue of climate change. It is therefore crucial that approaches are developed to renewable energy distribution that maximise the use of available resources while also maximising individual’s satisfaction with how resources are distributed. Multi-agent based models have clear potential in this area and could be a major asset to self-organising smart grids [6][7].

In this project, a model will be developed based on previous work in which agents exchange time slots in which they are able to use a shared renewable energy resource in order to maximise their individual satisfaction [8]. By incorporating various social learning strategies, the project will identify how the optimum trading strategies differ based on the distribution of resources.

The model will then go on to incorporate social goals such as trust and fairness [9]. This will be done by introducing opportunities for agents to break rules and utilise time slots that have not been allocated to them and evolving institutional rules to best reward or punish the behaviour of agents [10].

The project will finally go on to introduce real world data for energy demand and availability over time. Using this data to tune the model, suggestions will be developed for how individuals in real smart grids could alter their energy usage in order to maximise the use of renewable resources while minimising the impact on individual satisfaction.

## Research Questions
•How does the evolved trading strategy vary based on the distribution of resources?

• Which social learning strategies most efficiently converge on the optimum trading strategy(s)?

• By incorporating institutional rules into the model, can resources be distributed optimally while maintaining social goals?

• How do both trading strategies and social learning strategies need to adapt for the agents to perform effectively with varying resource availability and volume of agents?

• By introducing real world data, what suggestions can be drawn from the model for real world energy distribution in socio-technical smart grids?
